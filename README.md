SimbaExt!
========
This library is developed for Simba, by Jarl K. Holta. It contains a large set of generally useful functions.

The librarys aim is to make your coding experience in Simba better, simpler, and also aid you when you are working on 
computer vision tasks.

It contains stuff like corner detection, utilizes several color-finding techniques, and offers a bunch of "complex" point-array functions, sorting functions and much much more. 
SimbaExt also wraps a lot of it's methods around many of the default Simba-types to give you a cleaner, and simpler coding experience, for example `TPointArray.Remove(value)`.

Enjoy!
